# Tweet Back Up
Code to parse Twitter tweet archives and generate a static webpage displaying those tweets.

I was going to polish this up and make it ready for general use, but now the urgency has lessened, as I've gotten my Twitter account back. Still, I will eventually get around to cleaning it up all the same. If you wanted to make use of it in its current state, it wouldn't be difficult to figure out how to do so.

(Perhaps I should've named this Tweets Back Up? It puts your tweets back up. I'm happy with the pun of sorts on "backup" and "back up", but I can't figure out if I should say "Tweet" or "Tweets". I don't know. Names are a bother.)
