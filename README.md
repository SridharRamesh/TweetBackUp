# Tweet Back Up
Code to parse Twitter tweet archives and generate a static webpage displaying those tweets.

(Perhaps I should've named this Tweets Back Up? It puts your tweets back up. I'm happy with the pun of sorts on "backup" and "back up", but I can't figure out if I should say "Tweet" or "Tweets". I don't know. Names are a bother.)
